# CopyLater - Keeps a track of the copied textual information
It just so happens that you have forgotten to save some important copied information like a link or some number and it then gets deleted from the clipboard. This application stores the textual information that you have been copying so that you never it.
There are two files:
  1) store_data.py: Tracks and stores the copied information
  2) app.py: Produces a web interface for you to manage the copied information
